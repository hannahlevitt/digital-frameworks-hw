# Congressman Paul Mitchell
## R-MI 10

Congressman Paul Mitchell was elected in 2016 to represent the 10th district of Michigan in the 115th United States Congress. The 10th district of Michigan includes Huron, Sanilac, Lapeer (the Congressman's home county), St. Clair and Macomb counties. 

Prior to serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mitchell worked at the State of Michigan, Chrysler and served as the CEO of Ross Education. He is from Michigan and is a graduate of Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI. His political history includes organizing the defeat of the largest tax increase in fifty years in Michigan. 

As part of his role as a Congressman, Mitchell serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the Education and Workforce Committee, and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 

In a June 27 press release, Mitchell supported President Donald Trump's proposal to rescind the Waters of the United States rule, calling it "flawed" for unnecessarily regulating streams, creeks and ponds. Agriculture is a key issue for Mitchell, as much of his district is covered by agricultural lands. As part of his platform, he advocated regulations that make sense for both the farmer and the taxpayer. 

Furthermore, Mitchell supports a "smart regulatory system" overall as part of his stance on the economy. "While some regulation is necessary, we need to ensure that the regulations we do have in place are smart: that they are necessary, designed efficiently and have the put the least possible strain on those trying to make the economy move," Mitchell said on his website. 

Mitchell also supports a strong military, greater energy independence, change in healthcare, education flexibility, strengthening of critical infrastructure and protection of the Great Lakes.
