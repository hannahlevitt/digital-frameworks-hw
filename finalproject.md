# Coastal Flooding in the United Kingdom #

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, rising sea levels and storms that push water towards the shore cause flooding along the coastline. 

In February 2017, the British Oceanographic Data Centre published a data set of coastal flooding in the United Kingdom from 1915-2016. After the Centre determined that the original coastal flooding database was "inevitably biased due to the inconsistent spatial and temporal coverage of sea-level observations utilised," it created a new database using new data sources including newspapers, weather reports and social media. The floods were then ranked on a scale from 1-6; 1 representing the least severe option - "nuisance" - and 6 representing the most severe - "disaster."  

As apparent in the chart below, although the number of incidents during each five year period fluctuated a bit and actually trended slightly downwards in recent years, the severity of the incidents increased over time. With one exception, the average severity of incidents for each five year period stayed below 2.0 for the bulk of the data set (the exception is 1976-1980, when the average severity of incidents was 2.04). Beginning with the 2001-2005 period, the average severity of incidents over each five year period was above 2.0: 2.71 for 2001-2005, 2.11 for 2006-2010 and 2.11 for 2011-2015.

Process:

My process in completing this assignment began with visiting the Data is Plural website and browsing around the different data sets on the first few pages. After looking at a few different options, I landed on this because it is relevant to the work that I have been doing this summer at the World Wildlife Fund. I was working as a communications intern for the Environment and Disaster Management program, which does a lot of work in environmentally responsible disaster relief worldwide. One of the main topics that the program focuses on is flooding, so over the summer I have learned a lot about climate change and the impacts it has on the variability of water. I have even read some about coastal flooding in the United Kingdom. Based on that experience, when I found this data set I anticipated that there may be a story to tell here about either increasing quantity or severity of flooding incidents in the U.K. 

In order to create this data story and visualization, I first downloaded the data set and played around with it to determine the best angle to take to tell a good story with it. I eventually landed on the data about the frequency and severity of the incidents as the most compelling story to tell. I split it into five year increments for easier visualization purposes and to attempt to control for any irregular fluctuations in weather patterns. I used the =countif{} function to get the numbers for my chart, and then plugged them in to create the visualization. Once I had my smaller set of numbers that I used in my chart, I used those to find the number of incidents per five-year time period and the average severity of the incidents.
