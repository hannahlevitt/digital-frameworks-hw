# Coastal Flooding in the United Kingdom #

Although the number of coastal flooding incidents per year in the United Kingdom has not increased over the past 100 years, the severity of the incidents has. 

When separated into five year time periods, the number of coastal flooding incidents was above and below the average of 16.15 incidents over each time period. However, the average severity of the incidents for each five year time period was 1.67 on a scale of 1 (least severe) to 6 (most severe). The five year time periods in more recent history have consistently higher average incident severities than the five year time periods earlier in the century.   

In February 2017, the British Oceanographic Data Centre published a data set of coastal flooding in the United Kingdom from 1915-2016. After the Centre determined that the original coastal flooding database was "inevitably biased due to the inconsistent spatial and temporal coverage of sea-level observations utilised," it created a new database using new data sources including newspapers, weather reports and social media. The floods were then ranked on a scale from 1-6; 1 representing the least severe option - "nuisance" - and 6 representing the most severe - "disaster."  

As apparent in the chart below, although the number of incidents during each five year period fluctuated a bit and actually trended slightly downwards in recent years, the severity of the incidents increased over time. With one exception, the average severity of incidents for each five year period stayed below 2.0 for the bulk of the data set (the exception is 1976-1980, when the average severity of incidents was 2.04). Beginning with the 2001-2005 period, the average severity of incidents over each five year period was above 2.0: 2.71 for 2001-2005, 2.11 for 2006-2010 and 2.11 for 2011-2015. 

Over the time period from 1916-2015, there was one coastal flooding event that had the highest severity ranking of 6 - the North Sea Flood in 1953. According to the UK Met Office website, this disaster was caused by "exceptional weather conditions, coupled with an inability to warn people." The website also says that this is known as the worst peacetime disaster to ever hit the UK. 

In January 1953, the North Sea experienced a tidal surge that raised the tide 5.6 meters above mean sea level. Strong winds of up to 126 miles per hour exacerbated the situation. Large parts of Eastern England were damaged, as well as the Netherlands, Belgium and Scotland. 307 died in England, 19 in Scotland and 1800 in the Netherlands. 32,000 people were evacuated, 160,000 acres were inundated with sea water and unusable for years to follow, and the estimated damage was £50 million - or £1.2 billion in today's dollars (UK Met Office). 

Damage to infrastructure included power stations, gas works, roads, railways, sewage services and water services. As a result of this disaster, weather forecasting changed drastically with the use of computers and satellite data according to the UK Met Office. 

In addition to the most severe flooding incident in the data set, there were eight level 5 incidents, seven of which were in the second half of the data (since 1976). 

Of the 323 incidents that took place between 1916 and 2015, 56.7 percent of them, or 183 incidents, were level 1 incidents. 

According to a September 2016 flood resilience review from the U.K. Cabinet Office and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the U.K. plans to spend £2.3 billion between 2015 and 2021 to strengthen the flood and coastal defenses. The paper cites record rainfall levels and river levels as causing disruptions to daily life around the country.  

Although the paper states that the current models are not robust enough to attribute recent flooding events to climate change, it says that sea level along the English Channel rose 12 cm in the 20th century. The higher sea levels increase the chance of a coastal flood during a storm surge event, the paper says. 

The paper recommends that the Met Office conduct case studies and stress tests to determine the risks and vulnerabilities associated with increased coastal flooding. These kinds of tests will improve understanding of the risks associated with increased flooding in terms of the impact on people, infrastructure and the economy that the floods may have. As demonstrated by the above statistics on the 1953 flooding, the impact has the potential to be stark and widespread. 

According to a NASA web page titled "The Water Cycle and Climate Change," potential changes in the Earth's water cycle due to climate change are among the most serious environmental policy issues society is currently facing. Although, as stated above, there is not enough data/modeling to attribute the uptick in severity of recent flooding events in the U.K. to climate change according to the 2016 U.K. paper, the science community agrees that the Earth's climate is changing, and that these changes may affect water patterns.

Process:

My process in completing this assignment began with visiting the Data is Plural website and browsing around the different data sets on the first few pages. After looking at a few different options, I landed on this because it is relevant to the work that I have been doing this summer at the World Wildlife Fund. I was working as a communications intern for the Environment and Disaster Management program, which does a lot of work in environmentally responsible disaster relief worldwide. One of the main topics that the program focuses on is flooding, so over the summer I have learned a lot about climate change and the impacts it has on the variability of water. I have even read some about coastal flooding in the United Kingdom. Based on that experience, when I found this data set I anticipated that there may be a story to tell here about either increasing quantity or severity of flooding incidents in the U.K. 

In order to create this data story and visualization, I first downloaded the data set and played around with it to determine the best angle to take to tell a good story with it. I eventually landed on the data about the frequency and severity of the incidents as the most compelling story to tell. I split it into five year increments for easier visualization purposes and to attempt to control for any irregular fluctuations in weather patterns. I used the =countif{} function to get the numbers for my chart, and then plugged them in to create the visualization. Once I had my smaller set of numbers that I used in my chart, I used those to find the number of incidents per five-year time period and the average severity of the incidents.
